   Guidelines
   Please create a GIT repository to share your code - this should then be shared with
   Laura-Jane Timewell.

As you work, commit as often as you feel necessary and follow the guidelines here for your
message format - https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages.
For your PHP code, please follow PSR-12 style guidelines as close as possible. For
JavaScript, HTML and CSS use two spaces for indentation and a similar naming convention
to that used in your PHP code.
We would like to see a clean consistent coding style!
